"""
calmechanics module

This module contains functions for mechanical calculations including deformation, 
strain analysis, and lattice stretching. These functions are essential for evaluating 
the mechanical properties of materials under different conditions.

Submodules:
    - deformation: Contains functions for calculating deformation matrices.
    - strain: Contains functions for calculating principal and shear strains.
    - stretch: Contains functions for calculating relative stretch and lattice stretching.
