"""
electronic_structure module

This module provides functions related to quantum mechanics (QM) calculations, 
especially focused on generating k-points for material simulations. These tools 
are essential for performing density functional theory (DFT) or other electronic 
structure calculations.

Submodules:
    - universal: Some universal functions for electronic structure calculations.
    - plotter: Plotting tools for electronic structure calculations (taken from pymatgen 2024.10.29).
