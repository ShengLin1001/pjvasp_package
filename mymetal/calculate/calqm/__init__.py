"""
calqm module

This module provides functions related to quantum mechanics (QM) calculations, 
especially focused on generating k-points for material simulations. These tools 
are essential for performing density functional theory (DFT) or other electronic 
structure calculations.

Submodules:
    - kpoints: Contains functions for generating k-points for quantum mechanics calculations.
