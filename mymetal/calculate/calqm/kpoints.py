kpoints module

This module provides functions for generating k-points in the Brillouin zone, 
which are essential for quantum mechanical simulations such as density functional 
theory (DFT). K-points are used to sample the reciprocal space in periodic systems.

Functions:
    - generate_kpoints: Generate a set of k-points for a given material structure.
